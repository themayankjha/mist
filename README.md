### Overview
A RPG style choose your adventure game written in C++.

This code is compatible with the Borland C++ compiler only, since I wrote this when I was taught C++ using Borland compiler. That is a problem because the last stable release of this Compiler that I could easily find was released in 1997 for Windows Machines Only. Hence building from the source will be a problem. However, I might port this code to support modern compilers while also making it more elegant and less spaghetti.

To experience the game you can download the windows release that can be found in the releases tab or compile from source.

All contributions are welcome.
